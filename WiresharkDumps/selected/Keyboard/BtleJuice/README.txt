Here is what happened:

- dummy device created successfully
- Leandro's iPhone detected devices as "desktop-29", the host name of the core
- iPhone managed to establish connection
- got some output from GUI
- iPhone kept saying that device was connected
- devices did not disconnect but no interaction between keyboard and phone possible
